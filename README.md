# Realization of A star algorithm in Java 
For my university project I implemented the A star algorithm using matrix 5x5.
It's a pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest route beetween two nodes in a graph(in this case between two cells in 2d array).

<u>***Technologies:***</u> 

- JDK version 18 

***<u>Initialization:</u>***
Firstly, you need to clone the git repository: 
- ```
  git clone https://github.com/ivanivanovv13/AStarAlgorithm.git
```

After completion of this guide you need to open your Java editor and load clonned resources

- File -> Open -> {path to the directory where you clone this repository}

You are ready to go!
